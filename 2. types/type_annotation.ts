/// TYPE ANOTATION

/// What is Type Annotation in TypeScript
// TypeScript uses type annotations to explicitly specify types for identifiers such as variables, functions, objects, etc.

// TypeScript uses the syntax : type after an identifier as the type annotation, which type can be any valid type.

// Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.
